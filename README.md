# Curve RAG

Rag approach using hyperbolic geometry knowledge graphs.

Steps:
- Creates graph using an LLM
- Creates embeddings of graph nodes using [Low-Dimensional Hyperbolic Knowledge Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00545) [6]
- Allows RAG queries, using graph embeddings to find relevant information

## Usage (To update)

To train and evaluate a KG embedding model for the link prediction task, use the run.py script:

```bash
usage: python .\run.py --multi_c --debug --max_epoch 3 --dataset dataset_name
```
